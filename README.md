# GAShooter

Decided to play around with Genetic Algorithms and see if I can train enemy AI for a space shooter game.

## TODO:
  + Implement shooting
  + Implement a better fitness function and crossover (Track age and points?)
  + Add multiple agent pools? (clans?)
  + Add obstacles...Asteroids?
  + Visually track 1st + 2nd agent and newest agent
  + List of Agents by fitness function/age?
  
## Ideas:
  + Agents color depending on pool/clan?
  + Different bullet types??
  + Different agent types??
  + Agents "eat" each other??
  + Agent leaves food when it dies?
